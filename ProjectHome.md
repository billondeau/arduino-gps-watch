Garlow is a simple Arduino GPS watch that works like a Garmin.

The device gives GPS information which can be logged on SD card and shown on a OLED display. It can be carried as a watch or simply used as a GPS data logger.

The whole system is based on the Arduino Nano, with a Lipo power management module which enables USB battery recharge.

Garlow stands for GPS Arduino Rechargeable Logger OLED Watch.
